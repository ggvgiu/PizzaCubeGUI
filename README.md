# PizzaCubeGUI
Relay script for improving the baking of diabolic pizzas in KolMafia.

My in-game character is Lacey Jones (#2993889).

Type this in your CLI:

svn checkout https://github.com/ggvgiu/PizzaCubeGUI/branches/Release

Seems to be working.

Features:

Projected:

 - Performance improvements on PRO interface
 - Effects of note suggestions
 
Distant future:

Known bugs:
 - Adding and removing ingredients tends to cause ingredient count to bug (also happens in vanilla though)
