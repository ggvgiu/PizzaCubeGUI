# PizzaCubeGUI
Relay script for improving the baking of diabolic pizzas in KolMafia.

My in-game character is Lacey Jones (#2993889).

Type this in your CLI:

svn checkout https://github.com/ggvgiu/PizzaCubeGUI/branches/Release

Seems to be working.

Features:
 - Predictions for adventure gains and effect durations
 - Predictions for possible effects
 - Filtering by search string and first letter
 - Ordering by meat price, letter count, alphabetical, all reversible
 - CLI log of consumed pizza ingredients and resulting effect / adventure gain

Projected:
 - Filter out effects that don't work
 - Enable / disable interface
 - Interface improvements
 - Effects of note suggestions
 
Distant future:
 - Save favorite pizzas
 - One-click baking
 - Bake by desired effect
 - Whole new interface

Known bugs:
 - Adding and removing ingredients tends to cause ingredient count to bug (also happens in vanilla though)
